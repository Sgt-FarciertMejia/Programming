IOT use python 3 type python3 in terminal for ver 3.6.9
>>> is the REPL
Character Types -Int, char, strings, floats, boolean
Brace expansion ex. print(type(a)) - working from inside out function a is executed followed by type lastly print
for bool while using string all strings are true except for empty string for example '' = false while ' ' = true
type casting str(1) will make it a string instead of an int
python automatically type casts integers and floats
can also add strings 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World!'
cannot add int and floats to strings however you can multiply
difference between division / 15 / 8 = 1.875 where interger division // 15 // 8 = 1
modulus is remainder 15 % 8 = 7
exponents is ** 5 ** 2 = 25
'{}{}!'.format('Hello','World') prints 'Hello World!'- this is a method function this modifies an object 
tuple are inmutable while lists are mutable meaning it can change
lists start and end w/ []
tuple start and end w/ ()
index notation is tuple or list ('example')[x]
.append() allows you to append things to a list
.join() can join a list together requires a string in the beginninig 
dlist[0] = 'j' changes first element to j
.split() will split string on the delimeter placed in parenthesis and after split a list will be returned
''' will comment an entire section requires ''' codes at desired start and end points
input() function used to input a value and returns a string
python3 shebang line is #!/usr/bin/env python3
Example Script to check if number is divisible by another number (to see if a number is divisible by a number its x % x == 0)
  ```1 #!/usr/bin/env python3
  2 usr = int(input('Type a number:\n'))
  3 if usr % 3 == 0 and usr % 5  == 0:#divisible by 3 and 5
  4     print('fizzbuzz')
  5 elif usr % 5 == 0:#divisible by 5
  6     print('buzz')
  7 elif usr % 3 == 0:#divisible by 3
  8     print('fizz')
  9 else:#not divisible by 3 or 5
 10     print(usr)```

Function must be defined first then called to execute 
def fizzbuzz():
  code block
fizzbuzz()

while loops
```def test():
  while True:
    user = input("Type 'Pass', 'Break', 'Continue', or 'Return':\n")
    if user == 'Pass':
      pass
      print('This is pass.')
    elif user == 'Break':
      break
      print('This is Break.')
    elif user == 'Continue':
      continue
      print('This is Continue.')
    elif user == 'Return':
      return
      prinit('This is return')
    else:
      print('Please choose a valid option.')
test():```
