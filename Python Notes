Character Types -Int, char, strings, floats, boolean
Brace expansion ex. print(type(a)) - working from inside out function a is executed followed by type lastly print
for bool while using string all strings are true except for empty string for example '' = false while ' ' = true
type casting str(1) will make it a string instead of an int
python automatically type casts integers and floats
can also add strings 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World!'
cannot add int and floats to strings however you can multiply
